## Aim

The contact of the user who scored safely in ideal use may seem safe, but of course this is not the goal. I know the difficulty of proposing such a decision without scientific findings. Especially considering that the input of information will depend only on the request of the user. So with a more helpful role;

 - Creating quarantine awareness    
 - Keeping a quarantine day record   
 - Keeping your breach records    
 - Calculating / reporting your
   quarantina

## Features

The design subject is very important to me and I think it is the factor that affects usability the most. So my main goal is to make an interface that does not tire the user. A streamlined and fast interface design that is as simple, beautiful as possible, can message with colors.

Record entry in less than 30 seconds with simple question and answers. (For example, ‘’Have you been in an indoor without mask?”, “Was it longer than 15 minutes?”)

Easy to use output / sharing of reported data outside the application. (Eg pdf, png, jpg)
